            <p>I'm a Computer Science major that's from Marietta, GA studying at BYU-Idaho in Rexburg, ID. I love to meet people, go on hikes, and learn about computers.
                I have always enjoyed learning new things, and so I am excited to be able to discover the joys of web development. I am a return missionary, having served 
                in the Brazil Natal Mission. It was there that I found out how rewarding it is to be able to test yourself and see what you can do after taking the time to 
                really learn and apply new things. My goal now is to develop software and make a difference wherever I may find myself.
